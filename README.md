# Gameboy-logs
Emulation logs of common beginner ROMs for the Gameboy.
Currently contains a log of the boot ROM (DMG) as well as all of Blargg's ROMs

All these logs were generated with my own emulator which passes Blargg's CPU tests.

For the convenience of anyone who uses them, LY (MMIO register at 0xFF44) is stubbed to 0x90 permanently.
